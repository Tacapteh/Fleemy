The interaction chronicles the AI engineer's iterative development of the Fleemy web application based on evolving and increasingly detailed user requirements. Initially, the AI engineer proposed a phased approach, prioritizing core UI and authentication. A significant challenge was the user's  file, which was repeatedly referenced but inaccessible, leading to a crucial moment where the user transcribed its entire logic. The AI engineer frequently claimed complete implementation after significant  operations, only for the user to provide more specific or refined requirements, suggesting a mismatch between AI's interpretation and user's expectation. The conversation progressively shifted from high-level app creation to detailed module implementation and precise UI/UX replication. The latest focus is on ensuring the Planning module's exact visual and functional fidelity.

<product_requirements>
Fleemy is a comprehensive web application for freelancers and small teams to manage planning, tasks, clients, quotes, and invoicing.
**Core Features:**
*   **Interactive Planning:** Week and month views with navigation, 9h-18h time slots, colored event statuses (Payé, Non payé, En attente, Pas travaillé), event CRUD (create/edit/delete) via modals, and automatic earnings calculation. Supports multi-user teams with read-only access for others. Data persisted by .
*   **Task Management:** Weekly tasks with name, price, color (pastel palette), 50 fixed icons, and configurable time slots, displayed in planning. A separate quick To-do List with checkboxes and priorities (low, normal, urgent).
*   **Client Management:** Persistent client list with autocompletion for events and quotes.
*   **Quotes & Invoicing:** Customizable quote creation (quantity, price, hours, templates), PDF export, conversion to invoice with statuses (Envoyé, Validé, Payé, En retard), and automatic totals.
*   **Dashboard:** Centralized overview of upcoming events, tasks, revenues, and quotes.
*   **Multi-User & Teams:** Google or Emergent authentication, users can create/join teams via link, view others' read-only planning, and switch between personal/team planning.
*   **UI/UX:** Modern, clean, responsive design (mobile & desktop) using TailwindCSS, fluid animations/transitions, and French language with future multi-language support.
*   **Data Persistence:** Automatic saving to App Emergent's internal MongoDB database, with offline support via IndexedDB.
*   **Architecture:** React frontend, FastAPI backend, MongoDB database. Side menu for navigation.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **React:** Frontend framework for building user interfaces.
-   **FastAPI:** Python web framework for building backend APIs.
-   **MongoDB:** NoSQL database for data persistence.
-   **TailwindCSS:** Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
-   **Emergent Authentication:** Integrated authentication system.
-   **IndexedDB:** Browser-side database for offline data persistence.
-   **Pydantic:** Python library for data validation and settings management.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend.


-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: This is the main FastAPI application file handling all API endpoints, database interactions, and business logic. It defines routes for authentication, user management, planning, tasks, teams, and earnings calculations.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   Initially rewritten in bulk to establish the FastAPI server structure, integrate Emergent authentication, and set up MongoDB connections.
        -   Includes models for , , , , , , , and .
        -   Authentication endpoints for user login and session management are defined.
        -   CRUD operations for events and tasks are present.
        -   An  prefix is used for all routes as per Kubernetes ingress rules.
        -   An  endpoint was recently added to facilitate earnings calculation.
        -   Minor fixes, including a root endpoint () and potential linting corrections.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: The main React component that orchestrates the application's UI, including routing, context provision, and rendering various modules (Dashboard, Planning, Tasks, etc.). It communicates with the backend via API calls.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   Initially rewritten in bulk to set up the React application, integrate TailwindCSS, and establish the initial authentication flow.
        -   Progressively updated to include components for the Dashboard, side menu, To-do List, and the core Planning module.
        -   Handles state management for events, tasks, and user sessions.
        -   Includes logic for week/month view navigation, event creation/editing/deletion modals, and earnings display.
        -   Recent changes focus on precisely replicating the visual style of the original planning table, including specific CSS classes and dimensions (e.g., 96px height for time slots), and ensuring all event functionalities (create, edit, delete) are seamlessly integrated.

-   ** / **:
    -   **Summary**: These files contain the global and component-specific CSS styles, primarily leveraging TailwindCSS.
    -   **Changes Made**: These files were created/modified during initial setup to apply the modern, minimalist design. More recently, specific styles (e.g., , , , ) were refined or added to precisely match the user's original  for the planning table's visual appearance, including fixed heights (96px) and specific color schemes.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: The entry point for the web application, serving as the root HTML file.
    -   **Changes Made**: Contains basic HTML structure and likely integrates JavaScript bundles. User requested a distinct homepage, implying this file or a React component rendered within it, would become a landing page.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   Full implementation of the  module, including PDF export.
-   Complete implementation of the  module with full CRUD and persistence beyond just autocompletion within events.
-   Full implementation of  (beyond current basic CRUD) including detailed rendering and calculations within the planning grid.
-   Further enhancements to the  as per the most comprehensive requirements.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was focused on implementing and refining the **Planning module** of Fleemy, based on the user's explicit request.

The Planning module now features:
*   **Interactive Week View**: A grid with columns for Monday-Friday and rows for 9 AM to 6 PM time slots. Events are displayed as colored blocks (Green for Paid, Red for Unpaid, Orange for Pending, Violet for Not Worked).
*   **Event Management**: Clicking on an empty slot opens a modal for creating new events (description, day, start/end times, type). Clicking an existing event opens a modal for editing or deleting it. A Clear Week button allows mass deletion of events for the current week.
*   **Navigation**: Smooth navigation between previous/next weeks and months is implemented.
*   **Month View**: A calendar displays events, showing a maximum of two events per day and +X others for more. Clicking a day shows all events for that day in a modal.
*   **Multi-User Support**: If part of a team, users can select and view other members' planning, which is read-only. Personal planning is fully editable.
*   **Automatic Earnings Calculation**: Real-time display of paid, unpaid, and pending earnings, based on a configurable hourly rate.

The *most recent* work involved ensuring the **visual appearance** of the planning table exactly matches the user's original  and a provided capture. This included applying specific CSS styles for rows, columns, borders, spacing, fixed event heights (96px), and precise color mapping for different event types. The AI engineer performed several  operations (likely on CSS and React components) to achieve this visual fidelity.
